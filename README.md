## About
This is a word score game.  The goal of the game is to get the most points by making an English word with letters you took from the bag.  Each letter has a point value, and each letter can only be used once in your turn.  The bag has 100 letters in it.  Once you use a letter from the bag it will be discarded.  The game is over when all the letter have been drawn from the bag and your hand is empty.  You can release your hand if you don't have any words to make, but you can not get the value of those letters.

## Your Tasks
Write the JavaScript to allow the "blank" space to be a wild card.  It can be any letter that is missing from the word, but is worth no points.  For example if I had the letters "H" "E" "L" "S" "S" "_" "_" I could make the word "HELLO" by using "H" "E" "L" "_" "_".
Write logic to "end the game" when all letters are used from the bag and you have released your last unused letters from your hand.
Write the JavaScript needed to find the highest point word available in the dictionary.
Clean up the existing JavaScript code to be well formatted and have better performance (useless looping, use recursion when needed)
BONUS
