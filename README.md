## About
This is a word score game.  The goal of the game is to get the most points by making an English word with letters you took from the bag.  Each letter has a point value, and each letter can only be used once in your turn.  The bag has 100 letters in it.  Once you use a letter from the bag.

## Your Tasks
Write the JavaScript to allow the "blank" space to be a wild card.  It can be any letter that is missing from the word, but is worth no points.  For example if I had the letters "H" "E" "L" "S" "S" "_" "_" I could make the word "HELLO" by using "H" "E" "L" "_" "_".
Write the JavaScript needed to find the highest point word available in the dictionary.
Clean up the existing JavaScript code to be well formatted and have better performance (useless looping, use recursion when needed)
BONUS
Make the HTML look pretty
